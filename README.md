# training

A playground to do my code katas.


## Setup

### Create

```
src/training.rb
src/training.js
src/training.clj
src/training.scss
training.html
```

Those files are ignored and you can put your Katas there.

## To test/run Katas

- Javascript: I use quokkajs
- css: I use intellij to automatically refresh the browser
- ruby: emacs with xmp
- clojure: start the repl from your favorite code editor
