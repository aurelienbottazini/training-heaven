# training

A playground to do my code katas.


## Setup

### Create

```
src/training.rb
src/training.js
src/training.clj
src/training.scss

```

Those files are ignored and you can put your Katas there.

### Install packages

- `yarn`
- `bundle`

## To test/run your Katas

- Javascript: `yarn test`
- css/scss: `yarn start`, edit src/training.scss and go to http://localhost:8888
- ruby: `bundle exec guard`
- clojure: start the repl from your favorite code editor
