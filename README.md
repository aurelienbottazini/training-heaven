# training

A playground to do my code katas.


## Setup

### Create `training files`

```
touch ruby/training.rb clojure/src/training_heaven/training.clj html/training.scss html/training.html
```

Those files are ignored and you can put your Katas there.

## To test/run Katas

- Javascript: I use quokkajs
- css: I use intellij to automatically refresh the browser
- ruby: emacs with xmp
- clojure: start the repl from your favorite code editor
